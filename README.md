# StockRL
A project to use Reinforcement Learning to develop an algorithmic trading strategy to compete with the S&amp;P 500.

The `env` directory contains the environment that the RL algorithm uses; the `models` directory contains the output of the models; the `processor` directory contains the necessary steps for data processing; the `rl` directory contains the functions and objects that define the RL algorithm; and the `data` directory contains the train/test data. The gh_rl_script.ipynb is the jupyter notebook file which runs/tests the algorithm and generates the output

Some of the code was taken from the FinRL and elegantrl packages and repurposed/updated/corrected to fit my particular needs for this project.
